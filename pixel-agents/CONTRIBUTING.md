# Contributing to Pixel Agents

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pixel Agents! All contributions are welcome — features, bug fixes, documentation improvements, refactors, and more.

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), so your contributions will be too. No CLA or DCO is required.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22 recommended)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (v1.105.0 or later)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents.git
cd pixel-agents
npm install
cd webview-ui && npm install && cd ..
cd server && npm install && cd ..
npm run build
```

Then press **F5** in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

## Development Workflow

For development with live rebuilds, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This starts parallel watchers for both the extension backend (esbuild) and TypeScript type-checking.

> **Note:** The webview (Vite) is not included in `watch` — after changing webview code, run `npm run build:webview` or the full `npm run build`.

## Running the Mocked Pixel Agent

You can run the mocked Pixel Agent web app either from the CLI or from VS Code tasks.

### Option 1: CLI

From the repository root:

```bash
cd webview-ui
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) where the mocked app is available.

### Option 2: VS Code Run Task

1. Open the command palette and run **Tasks: Run Task**.
2. Select **Mocked Pixel Agent Dev Server**.
3. Open the local URL shown in the task terminal output (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Project Structure

| Directory     | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`        | Extension backend -- Node.js, VS Code API                       |
| `server/`     | Standalone HTTP server, hook installer, and test suite (Vitest) |
| `webview-ui/` | React + TypeScript frontend (separate Vite project)             |
| `scripts/`    | Asset extraction and generation tooling                         |
| `assets/`     | Bundled sprites, catalog, and default layout                    |

## Code Guidelines

### Constants

**No unused locals or parameters** (`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` are enabled). All magic numbers and strings are centralized — don't add inline constants to source files:

- **Extension backend:** `src/constants.ts`
- **Webview:** `webview-ui/src/constants.ts`
- **CSS variables:** `webview-ui/src/index.css` `:root` block (`--pixel-*` properties)

### UI Styling

The project uses a pixel art aesthetic. All overlays should use:

- Sharp corners (`border-radius: 0`)
- Solid backgrounds and `2px solid` borders
- Hard offset shadows (`2px 2px 0px`, no blur) — use `var(--pixel-shadow)`
- The FS Pixel Sans font (loaded in `index.css`)

These conventions are enforced by custom ESLint rules (`eslint-rules/pixel-agents-rules.mjs`):

| Rule               | Scope               | What it checks                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-inline-colors` | Extension + Webview | No hex/rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla literals outside `constants.ts`    |
| `pixel-shadow`     | Webview only        | Box shadows must use `var(--pixel-shadow)` or `2px 2px 0px` |
| `pixel-font`       | Webview only        | Font family must reference FS Pixel Sans                    |

These rules are set to `error` and will block your PR if violated.

## Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (webview + server)
npm test

# Run only server tests (Vitest)
npm run test:server

# Run only webview tests
npm run test:webview
```

Server tests cover the HTTP server, hook event routing, hook installer, and the hook script (integration test spawning a real Node process). They run after build since `claude-hook.test.ts` needs the compiled hook script at `dist/hooks/claude-hook.js`.

## End-to-End Tests

The `e2e/` directory contains Playwright tests that launch a real VS Code instance with the extension loaded in development mode.

### Running e2e tests locally

```bash
# Build the extension first (tests load the compiled output)
npm run build

# Runs the e2e test
npm run e2e

# Step-by-step debug mode
npm run e2e:debug
```

On the first run, `@vscode/test-electron` will download a stable VS Code release into `.vscode-test/` (≈200 MB). Subsequent runs reuse the cache.

### Artifacts

All test artifacts are written to `test-results/e2e/`:

| Path                                   | Contents                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test-results/e2e/videos/<test-name>/` | `.webm` screen recording for every test                                     |
| `playwright-report/e2e/`               | Playwright HTML report (`npx playwright show-report playwright-report/e2e`) |
| `test-results/e2e/*.png`               | Final screenshots saved on failure                                          |

On failure, the test output prints the path to the video for that run.

### Mock claude

Tests never invoke the real `claude` CLI. Instead, a bash script at `e2e/fixtures/mock-claude` is copied into an isolated `bin/` directory and prepended to `PATH` before VS Code starts.

The mock:

1. Parses `--session-id <uuid>` from its arguments.
2. Appends a line to `$HOME/.claude-mock/invocations.log` so tests can assert it was called.
3. Creates `$HOME/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl` with a minimal init line so the extension's file-watcher can detect the session.
4. Sleeps for 30 s (keeps the terminal alive) then exits.

Each test runs with an isolated `HOME` and `--user-data-dir`, so no test state leaks between runs or into your real VS Code profile.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Verify everything passes locally:
   ```bash
   npm run lint                         # Extension + server + webview lint
   npm run build                        # Type check + esbuild + Vite
   npm test                             # Unit + integration tests
   ```
   CI runs these same checks automatically on every PR.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with:
   - A **conventional commit PR title** (e.g. `feat: add zoom controls`, `fix: character freezing on terminal close`, `refactor: extract pathfinding module`). CI enforces this format — see [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
   - A clear description of what changed and why
   - How you tested the changes (steps to reproduce / verify)
   - **Screenshots or GIFs for any UI changes**

> **Note:** PRs are merged using **squash and merge** — all commits in your PR are combined into a single commit on `main`. Your PR title becomes the commit message, which is why the conventional commit format matters.
